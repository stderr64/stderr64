# Hi

This is my github user i use just for things that require github, my actual repositories are at https://git.xservers.dy.fi (i have my own server for this because i don' like github but i'm forced to use it because so many things are in github)

A bit about me: i'm just a programmer with over 16 years of experience and a guy who runs own servers on physically owned server computer.
